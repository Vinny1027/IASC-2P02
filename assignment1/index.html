      <h2>1. Flatness</h2>
      <p><span class= "clickable" id="part-one">From inside the cave...</span></p>

      <p class="text">The people in the cave first see a very long rhombus-looking shape. <span class= "clickable" id="first-change">Suddenly, it begins to move</span>. The shape looks weird as it moves up and down; it seems like it’s hitting itself against an imaginary box, trying to escape but is stuck. The people in the cave think it’s symbolic, trying to escape, yet there’s always something holding them inside even though there’s nothing there. They see the shape move up and down trying to leave its invisible box, but no matter what it does, it will always have the same fate; to have your mind hold you back from becoming free.<span class= "clickable" id="second-change"> The shape begins to move more erratically</span>. The shape begins to move more erratically</span>. They see the triangle move up, down, and diagonally, changing instantly from triangle to oval, again and again. The people in the cave think it has a mind of its own like them. They see this and think that it’s trying to escape, possibly from something that they don’t know about. It’s dark, it reflects the darkness within all of them. To them, the oval represents a mirror of what they can see in themselves. As the triangle moves around, it symbolizes change and growth even though there’s darkness within it</p>

      <p class="text">To me, the concept of Flatness by Nick Sousanis means that all of us see a certain perspective that we believe is true, such as the earth is flat, tomatoes are vegetables, monkeys only eat bananas, and many more. But just because you see one side of it, doesn’t mean it's what the truth is. Flatness is a one-sided perspective of the bigger picture. Believing that the truth is what you are taught by someone else rather than experiencing the truth with your own eyes. This meets the definition of what the people in the cave see because of how they see the “all-seeing eye”; all they believe is the rhombus shape moving up and down to escape its “box”, then it turns into the “all-seeing eye” to watch over them because that’s all they know. They have no perception of what is really going on because they can’t see it. Little do they know is that what they see is not 100% of the truth. In reality, the shape has always been an eye the entire time and is rotating and hovering in all types of directions rather than just moving in one singular way.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Seeing double</h2>
      <p><span class= "clickable" id="part-two">From outside the cave...</span></p>

      <p class="text">The people outside the cave see the “all-seeing eye,” but it’s completely different from what the people inside the cave see. To the people inside the cave, they see the “all-seeing eye” watch over them constantly, yet the people outside the cave see that the border protecting the eye has only been stationary and rotating while the physical eye inside the border has been pacing back and forth. <span class= "clickable" id="third-change">Then the eye starts moving up and down</span>. The people outside the cave are surprised because all this time the eye has been stationary until now. The people in the cave thought it was moving even though it wasn’t, but the people outside the cave actually witnessed the “all-seeing eye” physically move up and down. They believe the eye has had its second awakening and is beginning to have some sort of enlightenment. <span class= "clickable" id="fourth-change">Until it started spinning rapidly</span>. The people outside the cave start panicking because they don’t understand or know why the “all-seeing eye” is moving so fast. They think the eye is going to explode due to its enlightenment and its overstimulation of it. 
      </p>

      <p class="text">To me, the concept of seeing double is when there’s one absolute thing, yet there’s two different versions and interpretations of that absolute thing. This means that even though one absolute thing is said or done, others may have different perspectives and versions of interpretations of that absolute thing. As shown in the “story” with the “all-seeing eye”, the shape/eye is moving up and down; both are moving up and down to everyone but it’s different for the people inside and outside the cave. The people inside the cave believe it's moving, but it's not physically moving, but the object is rotating and the light creates the shadow where the shape looks like it’s pacing up and down. While the people outside of the cave see the eye physically moving up and down, rather than having the illusion of it moving up and down. These two realms are connected because the people inside and outside the cave see and witness two different things, yet they’re similar enough to be connected. Even though both parties are experiencing different things, in the end, that thing is still one object that is moving, regardless of what the reality is.
