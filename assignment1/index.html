      <h2>1. Flatness</h2>
      <p><span class= "clickable" id="part-one">From inside the cave...</span></p>

      <p class="text">The people in the cave first see a very long rhombus-looking shape. <span class= "clickable" id="first-change">Suddenly, it begins to move</span>. The shape looks weird as it moves up and down; it seems like it’s hitting itself against an imaginary box, trying to escape but is stuck. The people in the cave think it’s symbolic, trying to escape, yet there’s always something holding them inside even though there’s nothing there. They see the shape move up and down trying to leave its invisible box, but no matter what it does, it will always have the same fate; to have your mind hold you back from becoming free.<span class= "clickable" id="second-change"> The shape begins to move more erratically</span>. The shape begins to move more erratically</span>. They see the triangle move up, down, and diagonally, changing instantly from triangle to oval, again and again. The people in the cave think it has a mind of its own like them. They see this and think that it’s trying to escape, possibly from something that they don’t know about. It’s dark, it reflects the darkness within all of them. To them, the oval represents a mirror of what they can see in themselves. As the triangle moves around, it symbolizes change and growth even though there’s darkness within it</p>

      <p class="text">To me, the concept of Flatness by Nick Sousanis means that all of us see a certain perspective that we believe is true, such as the earth is flat, tomatoes are vegetables, monkeys only eat bananas, and many more. But just because you see one side of it, doesn’t mean it's what the truth is. Flatness is a one-sided perspective of the bigger picture. Believing that the truth is what you are taught by someone else rather than experiencing the truth with your own eyes. This meets the definition of what the people in the cave see because of how they see the “all-seeing eye”; all they believe is the rhombus shape moving up and down to escape its “box”, then it turns into the “all-seeing eye” to watch over them because that’s all they know. They have no perception of what is really going on because they can’t see it. Little do they know is that what they see is not 100% of the truth. In reality, the shape has always been an eye the entire time and is rotating and hovering in all types of directions rather than just moving in one singular way.
